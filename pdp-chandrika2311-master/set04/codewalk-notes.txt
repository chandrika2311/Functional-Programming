Correctness Score:- 14
TA Comments on Design:-


screensaver-3
Functionality checked! Working fine

class-list
Incomplete data definition for list of slips
Mistake in the  constructor template for slip
Missing halting measure. (deliverable missing)
Use constants!
Lot of code duplication! Design should be generalized! Duplicate checks while handling functionality 
Error messages must!
Purpose statements should be meaningful and clear. You are doing it in a wrong way! Eg: fn calling-comparison-list?
Mistake in the contract for few functions. Mistakes in the design strategy (wrong variable reference)

Suggestion: Follow 80 character limit
Follow proper  naming convention/ suitable names 
Code should be properly indented
Function names should be appropriate
Avoid dangling brackets
