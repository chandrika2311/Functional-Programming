TA Comments on Design for q1:-
100% test coverage not achieved
Missing data definitions, missing observer templates. At this point in the course, we expect Data definition to be all good!
Bug in the code! (Handling varexp, multiple rules as per PS 07 q1)
Function name choice should be more appropriate. Even strategy should make sense.
Should have Good Purpose statements! (Observed across multiple functions)
make-indent-sapces-func, wrong purpose statement! Inconsistency in usage.
Assumptions should be documented!
print-rest-args function is wrong! (Not at all expected!)

Suggestion:
80 column width (Spacing of the code)

TA Comments on Design for q2:-
Mistake in constructor template
Should have Good Purpose statements!
Avoid magic numbers!
Should have correct examples. Bug in the code, probe moves backward


Suggestion:
“on” should be “of”
